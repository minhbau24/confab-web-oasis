# URL and Redirect Checking Simplification

## Overview
We have simplified all URL and redirect checking in the application to make it more maintainable and easier to debug.

## Changes Made

### 1. login-script.js
- Removed complex URL validation and redirection checks
- Simplified the redirection logic to only verify if a URL ends with `.html`
- Removed unnecessary debug logging

### 2. auth.js
- Simplified the `getRedirectUrl()` function
- Removed complex path parsing and sanitization
- Now only accepts simple URLs ending with `.html`
- Eliminated PHP extension checks

### 3. Other Files
- Removed PHP extension checks from `path-sanitizer.js`
- Removed PHP extension checks from `api-helper.js`
- Simplified `checkCurrentUrl()` to only check for Windows paths

## Benefits
- Simpler, more maintainable code
- Easier debugging
- No more complex regular expressions for URL validation
- Clear, predictable behavior for redirects

## Notes for Developers
- All redirects should point to `.html` files
- The system will default to `index.html` if no valid redirect is provided
- Windows path detection remains for security (to prevent directory traversal)
- API calls are not affected and continue to use `.php` endpoints

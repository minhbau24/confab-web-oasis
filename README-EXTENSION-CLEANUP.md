# PHP and HTML Extension Check Cleanup

## Summary of Changes

All PHP and HTML extension checks have been removed from the codebase to simplify the application architecture and make debugging easier.

### Files Modified

1. **includes/redirect.php**
   - Simplified to the most basic form
   - Only checks if URL is not from the API folder

2. **js/api-helper.js**
   - Removed PHP extension checking from `checkCurrentUrl()` function
   - Kept Windows path security checks

3. **js/path-sanitizer.js**
   - Removed PHP extension checks and conversion
   - Simplified URL correction

4. **js/auth.js**
   - Removed PHP to HTML conversion in redirect handling
   - Fixed syntax issues from removed code
   - API calls to `.php` endpoints still remain as needed

5. **includes/header.php**
   - Simplified the `isActivePage()` function
   - Removed PHP extension checks
   - Removed warning about accessing PHP files directly

6. **login.html**
   - Added `api-helper.js` script reference to fix `checkCurrentUrl()` undefined error
   - Fixed formatting of footer container div

### Overall Architecture

- All files are now assumed to be `.html` for frontend
- API endpoints remain as `.php` files in `/api/` directory
- No automatic conversion between extensions
- Simplified URL handling and redirection logic

## Notes for Developers

1. Always link to `.html` files in your HTML/JS code
2. Always use the `/api/` path for API endpoints
3. The `logout.php` file was moved from the root to `/api/logout.php`
4. All authentication is now handled through the API endpoints

These changes make the codebase simpler and easier to maintain, allowing easier debugging of issues.

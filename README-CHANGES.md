# Frontend-Backend Separation Implementation

## Summary of Changes

### Authentication Fixes (June 21, 2025)
1. Fixed maximum call stack size exceeded error in `conferences-api.js`
   - Resolved infinite recursion in `getCurrentUser()` method
   - Implemented shallow copying to avoid reference issues
   - Added comprehensive debug tools in new `auth-debug.js` file

2. Added documentation in `docs/AUTHENTICATION-DEBUG.md`
   - Detailed explanation of the authentication system
   - Best practices for using authentication across modules
   - Debug instructions for authentication issues

### API Endpoints
1. Created new API endpoint for handling logout: `/api/logout.php`
   - Properly handles server-side session termination
   - Cleans up cookies
   - Returns JSON response

### JavaScript Updates
1. Enhanced `logout()` function in `js/auth.js` to:
   - Call the API endpoint for server-side logout
   - Continue with local storage cleanup even if API call fails
   - Redirect to index.html

### PHP Cleanup
1. Simplified `includes/redirect.php` for easier bug fixing
   - Reduced unnecessary code
   - Maintained core functionality (redirecting non-API PHP files to HTML)
   
2. Removed `logout.php` from the root directory
   - Functionality now handled by API + JavaScript
   - A backup was created before deletion

### Header Integration
1. Updated the logout link in `includes/header.php` to use the JavaScript function:
   - Changed from `href="logout.php"` to `href="#" onclick="logout()"`

## Architecture Overview

The project now follows a clean separation between frontend and backend:

1. **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
   - All UI rendering handled by client-side code
   - API calls for data and authentication

2. **Backend**: PHP API endpoints only
   - No direct HTML rendering
   - JSON responses
   - Authentication/sessions management

This separation makes the codebase more maintainable and easier to debug.

## Future Considerations

1. Consider replacing PHP header/footer includes with JavaScript-based components
2. Implement token-based authentication for better security and separation
3. Further clean up any remaining direct PHP-to-HTML dependencies

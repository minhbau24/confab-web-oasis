# Converting from Local JS Data to API Backend

## Overview
The conferences page has been successfully converted from using local JavaScript data to fetching data from the backend API. This change allows for real-time data updates and proper interaction with the database.

## Changes Made

1. **Created `conferences-api.js`**
   - Replaces the original `conferences.js`
   - Implements API fetch functionality
   - Adds proper error handling and loading states
   - Maintains the same UI and filtering functionality

2. **Updated `conferences.html`**
   - Added reference to `api-helper.js` for API call utilities
   - Changed script reference from `conferences.js` to `conferences-api.js`
   - Added a test script to verify API functionality

3. **Added API Integration**
   - Fetches conference data from `api/conferences.php`
   - Implements conference registration via `api/conference_registration.php`
   - Maintains compatibility with existing authentication system

## How It Works

1. When the page loads, it calls the API endpoint to get the list of conferences
2. The UI shows a loading spinner during the API call
3. Once data is received, it renders the conferences in the same format as before
4. All filtering functionality continues to work as before
5. Conference registration now calls the API instead of manipulating local data

## Testing

A test script `conferences-api-test.js` has been added that:
- Verifies that all required scripts are loaded
- Tests the API endpoint to ensure it returns valid data
- Reports results to the console for debugging

## Next Steps

If you wish to continue improving the API integration:

1. **Implement pagination** for large sets of conference data
2. Add ability to **filter on the server side** rather than client-side
3. Implement **real-time updates** using WebSockets or polling
4. Add more robust **error handling and recovery**

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify that the API endpoint is returning the expected format
3. Make sure the conference schema matches what the frontend expects
4. Confirm that authentication is working properly for protected operations

# Path Handling & URL Checking

## Current Implementation

We have simplified URL and path checking across the application:

1. **Removed Complex Checks**: We've removed complex URL validation, PHP extension checks, and excessive redirect logic.

2. **Simplified Approach**: Instead of multiple layers of checks, we now:
   - Use simple validation in `api-helper.js` - checking only for Windows paths
   - Only accept direct HTML references (.html extension)
   - Have a minimal redirect process

3. **Fixed Missing Files**: We've addressed:
   - Removed reference to non-existent `redirect-check.js`
   - Replaced external placeholders with local styled elements

## Recommended Practices

1. **Always use relative paths**: 
   ```
   ✅ Good: href="page.html"
   ✅ Good: href="/confab-web-oasis/page.html"
   ❌ Bad: href="C:\path\to\page.html"
   ```

2. **Always use .html extension for frontend**:
   ```
   ✅ Good: window.location.href = "page.html"
   ❌ Bad: window.location.href = "page.php" 
   ```

3. **Use proper API endpoints**:
   ```
   ✅ Good: fetch("api/endpoint.php")
   ❌ Bad: fetch("endpoint.php")
   ```

4. **Keep security checks minimal**:
   - Only check for truly problematic patterns like Windows paths
   - Don't over-validate URLs, which makes debugging harder

## Current Security Measures

1. The `path-sanitizer.js` prevents navigation to Windows absolute paths
2. The `api-helper.js` validates API URLs
3. The `auth.js` validates redirect URLs

These measures are now streamlined and don't introduce excessive restrictions.

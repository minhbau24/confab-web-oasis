# Authentication System - Fixes and Best Practices

## Issue Fixed

We identified and fixed an issue with the authentication system in the application:

1. **Problem**: The `header.js` was trying to access `user.name` where `user` could be null
2. **Root Cause**: 
   - `currentUser` in auth.js was defined as a local variable
   - Other scripts couldn't reliably access the current user information
   - No proper null checking when accessing user properties

3. **Solution**:
   - Exposed `getCurrentUser()` and `isLoggedIn()` functions globally
   - Added null checking in header.js
   - Updated the user retrieval in conferences-api.js
   - Added testing scripts to verify authentication works

## Authentication Architecture

The authentication system now works as follows:

1. **Auth State Storage**:
   - User data stored in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`
   - Authentication token stored securely

2. **Global Functions**:
   - `window.getCurrentUser()`: Gets the current logged-in user
   - `window.isLoggedIn()`: Checks if a user is authenticated

3. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - If auth.js isn't loaded, scripts can try to get user from localStorage
   - Default to guest user with null properties if nothing found

## Best Practices for Using Authentication

1. **Always Check Before Access**:
   ```javascript
   const user = getCurrentUser();
   if (user && user.name) {
       // Safe to use user.name
   }
   ```

2. **Use the Global Functions**:
   ```javascript
   if (typeof window.isLoggedIn === 'function' && window.isLoggedIn()) {
       // User is logged in
   }
   ```

3. **Check for Auth Initialization**:
   - Authentication might not be ready immediately
   - Use `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', ...)` to ensure auth is initialized

4. **Handle Guest Users Gracefully**:
   - Provide fallbacks for user properties
   - Example: `userName = user.name || "Người dùng";`

## Testing Authentication

The `auth-test.js` script provides comprehensive testing for the authentication system:

1. **Tests Included**:
   - Check if global functions are exposed
   - Verify logged-in state
   - Examine user object properties
   - Check localStorage data

2. **How to Use**:
   - Include the script in your HTML
   - Open browser console to see test results
   - Tests run automatically on page load

## Further Improvements

1. **Add a Global Auth State Event**:
   - Dispatch events when auth state changes
   - Components can listen and update accordingly

2. **Implement Token Refresh**:
   - Auto-refresh tokens before expiry
   - Silent re-authentication

3. **Add Session Expiry Handling**:
   - Notify users when their session is about to expire
   - Offer to extend the session
